Most cases essential hypertension no identifiable cause. Secondary causes: kidney disease, endocrine disorders, medications, pregnancy. Usually asymptomatic but severe elevation may cause: headache, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, nosebleeds rare. Complications if uncontrolled: stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney failure, vision loss, dementia. Diagnosis requires multiple readings on different occasions. Lifestyle modifications essential: DASH diet rich in fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole grains, reduce sodium less than 2300mg daily ideally 1500mg, maintain healthy weight, regular physical activity 150 minutes weekly, limit alcohol, quit smoking, stress management, adequate sleep. Medications when lifestyle insufficient: thiazide diuretics first-line especially in African populations, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, beta-blockers. Often requires multiple medications. Home blood pressure monitoring helpful. Regular follow-up essential.

    "topic": "Epilepsy",
    "content": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. It affects about 1% of the global population and is more common in Africa due to higher rates of brain infections and perinatal injuries. \n\nCauses: Idiopathic (no identifiable cause, often genetic) is most common. Symptomatic epilepsy may result from brain injury (trauma, stroke), infections (meningitis, encephalitis, neurocysticercosis from pork tapeworm, cerebral malaria, HIV), brain tumors, congenital brain malformations, or perinatal brain injury (birth asphyxia). \n\nSeizure types: \n1. Generalized seizures — involve both hemispheres of the brain: \n   - Tonic-clonic (grand mal): loss of consciousness, body stiffness (tonic phase) followed by rhythmic jerking (clonic phase), often with tongue biting, urinary incontinence, and confusion after recovery (postictal phase). \n   - Absence seizures (petit mal): brief staring spells or lapses in awareness, common in children. \n   - Myoclonic: sudden brief jerks of muscles. \n   - Atonic: sudden loss of muscle tone causing falls. \n   - Tonic: muscle stiffening only. \n   - Clonic: rhythmic jerking without initial stiffness. \n\n2. Focal (partial) seizures — start in one part of the brain: \n   - Simple focal: consciousness preserved, with localized jerking or sensory changes (numbness, tingling, visual disturbances). \n   - Complex focal: impaired awareness, automatisms (lip smacking, hand rubbing), confusion after seizure. \n\nSymptoms: Sudden loss of consciousness, convulsions, staring spells, confusion, temporary inability to respond, unusual sensations (smells, tastes, déjà vu), or sudden emotional changes. Warning signs (aura) may precede some seizures. \n\nDiagnosis: Clinical evaluation with detailed history, eyewitness accounts, and neurological examination. Investigations include electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect abnormal brain activity, brain imaging (CT/MRI) to identify structural causes, and blood tests for metabolic or infectious causes. \n\nTreatment: Long-term anticonvulsant (antiepileptic) medications such as carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, levetiracetam, or lamotrigine tailored to seizure type and individual tolerance. Adherence to medication is critical. Refractory cases may require surgery (resection of seizure focus), vagus nerve stimulation, or ketogenic diet. \n\nFirst aid during seizure: Do not restrain or put anything in the person’s mouth. Protect from injury by moving nearby objects, place on side (recovery position) after convulsion stops to maintain airway. Seek medical help if seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, occurs repeatedly without recovery, or if it is the first episode. \n\nComplications: Status epilepticus (prolonged seizure >5 minutes, life-threatening emergency), aspiration pneumonia, injury during seizures, cognitive or psychosocial problems due to stigma or poor management. \n\nPrevention: Prevent head injuries, perinatal care to avoid birth asphyxia, prompt treatment of CNS infections (meningitis, malaria, neurocysticercosis), avoid alcohol/drug abuse, and ensure medication adherence for known epileptics. Public education to reduce stigma and improve social inclusion is essential. \n\nPrognosis: With proper diagnosis and regular medication, 70–80% of people with epilepsy can achieve good seizure control and live normal lives. Untreated cases can lead to severe complications or death. \n\nEmergency management: Administer intravenous diazepam or lorazepam for prolonged seizures, followed by maintenance with appropriate antiepileptic drugs under medical supervision. \n\nEpilepsy is a manageable condition with proper medical care, adherence to therapy, and public awareness to eliminate misconceptions and discrimination.",

    "topic": "Forehead Headache",
    "content": "Forehead headache refers to pain or pressure felt in the front part of the head, above the eyes and eyebrows. It is a symptom rather than a disease and may result from various underlying causes involving muscles, nerves, sinuses, eyes, or stress-related factors. The pain may be dull, throbbing, sharp, or tight and can occur occasionally or chronically depending on the cause.\n\nCommon causes:\n1. **Tension-type headache** – The most frequent cause of forehead pain, due to muscle tension or stress. Pain is described as a tight band or pressure across the forehead or scalp, often triggered by emotional stress, anxiety, poor posture, eye strain, or fatigue.\n2. **Sinus headache (frontal sinusitis)** – Caused by inflammation or infection of the frontal sinuses located above the eyes. Symptoms include pain or pressure over the forehead, worse when bending forward, nasal congestion, thick nasal discharge, facial tenderness, and sometimes fever.\n3. **Migraine** – A neurological condition causing severe throbbing pain, often one-sided but can affect the forehead. Accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sound, or smell, and sometimes visual disturbances (aura). Triggered by stress, hormonal changes, lack of sleep, certain foods, dehydration, or environmental changes.\n4. **Eye strain (asthenopia)** – Caused by prolonged screen time, reading, or uncorrected vision problems. Leads to frontal headache, eye discomfort, blurred vision, and sometimes tearing or light sensitivity.\n5. **Cluster headache** – Severe, one-sided pain around or behind one eye radiating to the forehead, often associated with tearing, nasal congestion, and restlessness. Occurs in cyclical clusters (recurrent attacks for weeks/months).\n6. **Dehydration or heat exposure** – Can cause diffuse forehead pain, dizziness, and fatigue due to reduced fluid balance.\n7. **High blood pressure (hypertension)** – Occasionally causes dull forehead headache, especially if blood pressure is very high.\n8. **Medication overuse headache** – Rebound headaches from frequent use of painkillers like paracetamol, NSAIDs, or triptans.\n\nDiagnosis: Based on detailed history, symptom pattern, physical and neurological examination. Tests may include sinus X-ray/CT scan (for sinusitis), eye examination (for eye strain), blood pressure monitoring, or MRI brain if neurological cause suspected.\n\nTreatment:\n- **Tension headache**: Rest, stress management, neck and shoulder massage, stretching, adequate hydration, and pain relief with paracetamol or NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen). Relaxation techniques like yoga and mindfulness are helpful.\n- **Sinus headache**: Treat underlying sinusitis with antibiotics (if bacterial), decongestants, saline nasal irrigation, steam inhalation, and adequate hydration.\n- **Migraine**: Avoid triggers, rest in a dark quiet room, early use of triptans or NSAIDs, preventive medications for recurrent attacks (beta-blockers, topiramate, amitriptyline) as prescribed by doctor.\n- **Eye strain**: Reduce screen time, use proper lighting, corrective lenses if needed, follow the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds).\n- **Cluster headache**: Oxygen therapy, triptans, and preventive treatments (verapamil, corticosteroids) under medical supervision.\n\nPrevention: Maintain good posture, manage stress, stay hydrated, get adequate sleep, avoid skipping meals, limit caffeine and alcohol, use ergonomic workspace, and treat underlying vision or sinus problems. Regular exercise and relaxation techniques reduce recurrence.\n\nWhen to seek medical attention: If headache is severe and sudden (worst ever experienced), associated with fever, neck stiffness, confusion, blurred vision, weakness, vomiting, or occurs after head injury — these may indicate serious conditions like meningitis, brain hemorrhage, or tumor.\n\nPrognosis: Most forehead headaches are benign and resolve with rest and treatment of underlying cause. Persistent or worsening headaches require medical evaluation to prevent complications.",

They can occur immediately after surgery, within a few days, or even weeks later, depending on the type of surgery, patient health, and quality of postoperative care. Early recognition and management are critical to prevent severe outcomes.\n\nCommon categories of postoperative complications:\n\n1. **Wound-related complications:**\n   - **Infection:** Caused by bacterial contamination of the surgical site, leading to redness, warmth, swelling, pus discharge, pain, and fever. May progress to abscess or sepsis if untreated.\n   - **Dehiscence:** Partial or complete reopening of a surgical incision due to poor wound healing, infection, or excessive strain. Evisceration (protrusion of internal organs) is a surgical emergency.\n   - **Hematoma/Seroma:** Collection of blood (hematoma) or clear fluid (seroma) under the incision causing swelling and discomfort.\n\n2. **Bleeding (Hemorrhage):**\n   - Can occur internally or externally soon after surgery due to vessel injury or coagulation disorders. Presents with hypotension, pallor, tachycardia, and low urine output. Requires urgent control of bleeding source and volume replacement.\n\n3. **Infection-related systemic complications:**\n   - **Sepsis:** Life-threatening systemic infection from a surgical site, catheter, or lungs leading to fever, low blood pressure, rapid breathing, confusion, and multi-organ failure. Requires prompt antibiotics and intensive care.\n   - **Urinary tract infection (UTI):** Common after catheterization or pelvic surgery. Symptoms include burning urination, urgency, fever, and suprapubic pain.\n   - **Pneumonia:** Especially after chest or abdominal surgery due to shallow breathing, pain, or immobility.\n\n4. **Respiratory complications:**\n   - **Atelectasis:** Collapse of part of the lung due to shallow breathing or mucus plug, causing breathlessness and low oxygen levels. Common after abdominal or chest surgery.\n   - **Pulmonary embolism:** Blood clot from legs traveling to lungs, causing sudden chest pain, breathlessness, and low oxygen. A life-threatening emergency.\n\n5. **Circulatory complications:**\n   - **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):** Formation of blood clots in deep leg veins due to immobility, dehydration, or hypercoagulability. Presents with leg swelling, pain, and redness.\n   - **Shock:** From blood loss, infection, or cardiac failure, leading to low blood pressure, weak pulse, cold clammy skin, and organ dysfunction.\n\n6. **Gastrointestinal complications:**\n   - **Paralytic ileus:** Temporary cessation of bowel movements after abdominal surgery, leading to bloating, nausea, vomiting, and inability to pass stool or gas.\n   - **Nausea and vomiting:** Common due to anesthesia, pain medications, or ileus.\n   - **Constipation:** From painkillers and reduced mobility.\n\n7. **Urinary complications:**\n   - **Urinary retention:** Inability to pass urine after anesthesia or due to pain, common in elderly males or pelvic surgeries.\n\n8. **Pain-related issues:**\n   - Poorly controlled pain can delay healing, cause respiratory complications, and prolong hospital stay.\n\n9. **Anesthetic complications:**\n   - **Allergic reaction or anaphylaxis:** To anesthetic agents causing rash, breathing difficulty, or collapse.\n   - **Malignant hyperthermia:** Rare but fatal genetic reaction to anesthesia with high fever, muscle rigidity, and rapid heart rate.\n\n10. **Psychological and functional complications:**\n    - Anxiety, depression, delirium (acute confusion, especially in elderly), or post-traumatic stress following major surgery.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nBased on patient symptoms, physical examination, vital sign monitoring, wound inspection, laboratory tests (CBC, CRP), imaging (ultrasound, X-ray, CT), and cultures from wound or blood if infection suspected.\n\n**Treatment and management:**\n- Maintain sterile wound care and dressing.\n- Administer antibiotics for infections based on culture results.\n- Provide adequate pain control and hydration.\n- Encourage early mobilization to prevent DVT and pneumonia.\n- Respiratory exercises (deep breathing, incentive spirometry) after chest/abdominal surgery.\n- Monitor urine output and vital signs closely.\n- Manage bleeding with surgical re-exploration if needed.\n- Nutritional support to promote healing.\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Proper preoperative evaluation and optimization of patient conditions (diabetes, hypertension, anemia, infection control).\n- Strict aseptic surgical techniques.\n- Prophylactic antibiotics before and after surgery.\n- Early ambulation, adequate hydration, and use of compression stockings to prevent DVT.\n- Good wound care and patient education on hygiene.\n\n**When to seek medical attention:**\nSeek urgent care if there is high fever, increased wound pain, swelling, pus discharge, bleeding, breathlessness, chest pain, persistent vomiting, or confusion.\n\n**Prognosis:**\nMost postoperative complications can be prevented or managed effectively with prompt detection and care. Delay in treatment can result in severe infection, organ failure, or death. Recovery depends on early intervention, patient health status, and surgical complexity.",

Causes: benign most common stress, anxiety, caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, exercise, fever, anemia, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, medications decongestants, asthma inhalers, cardiac arrhythmias atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, premature beats. Description helps diagnosis: rapid regular suggest SVT, irregular suggest atrial fibrillation, skipped beats suggest premature contractions, pounding suggest anxiety or increased cardiac output. Triggers and relievers: precipitated by exercise, stress, or positional changes, terminated by vagal maneuvers suggest SVT. Associated symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, syncope suggest serious arrhythmia, tremor, weight loss, heat intolerance suggest hyperthyroidism. RED FLAGS requiring urgent evaluation: palpitations with chest pain, severe shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, family history of sudden death, structural heart disease, prolonged episodes. Assessment: vital signs and rhythm during episode if possible, cardiovascular examination, thyroid examination. Tests: ECG baseline, Holter monitor or event recorder to capture arrhythmia, echocardiogram if structural heart disease suspected, thyroid function tests, complete blood count. Management: treat underlying cause, reassurance if benign, avoid triggers, medications for arrhythmias beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics, ablation for recurrent SVT, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. When to seek care: palpitations lasting more than a few minutes, frequent episodes, associated concerning symptoms, palpitations in person with heart disease. Most palpitations benign but evaluation excludes serious causes. In Africa, rheumatic heart disease and anemia common causes. Severe anemia from malaria, hookworm, or malnutrition can cause palpitations from compensatory tachycardia.",
