Do not stop suddenly without doctor approval. Avoid NSAIDs (can reduce effectiveness). Monitor: blood pressure regularly, periodic blood tests for kidney function and potassium. Avoid during pregnancy (causes birth defects). Notify doctor if persistent cough, swelling, dizziness, or signs of infection.

Used to lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, raise HDL cholesterol, prevent cardiovascular events. Typical dose: 10-80mg once daily, usually taken at bedtime. Can take with or without food. Common side effects: muscle aches (report severe pain immediately), headache, nausea, diarrhea. Serious but rare: rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown - symptoms: severe muscle pain, weakness, dark urine - seek immediate care), liver damage (periodic liver function tests needed). Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice (increases drug levels). Continue healthy lifestyle: low-fat diet, regular exercise, weight management. Do not stop without consulting doctor. Notify doctor if: unexplained muscle pain/weakness, dark urine, yellowing of skin/eyes, unusual fatigue. Pregnancy category X - avoid if pregnant or planning pregnancy. Regular monitoring: lipid panel every 4-12 weeks initially, then every 3-12 months.",

Typical dose: 20-40mg once daily, 30-60 minutes before first meal of the day. Take on empty stomach for best absorption. Swallow capsule whole (don't chew). Common side effects: headache, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, gas. Long-term use concerns: increased fracture risk (ensure adequate calcium/vitamin D), vitamin B12 deficiency (may need supplementation), low magnesium (periodic monitoring if long-term use), slightly increased infection risk. Should be taken for shortest effective duration. Lifestyle modifications still important: avoid trigger foods (spicy, fatty, acidic foods, chocolate, caffeine), eat smaller meals, don't lie down within 3 hours of eating, elevate head of bed, maintain healthy weight, quit smoking. If symptoms persist on medication, see doctor. Don't take more than 14 days without medical supervision. Can interact with some medications (clopidogrel, warfarin) - inform all providers.",

Management: minimize exposure (check pollen counts, stay indoors when high, keep windows closed, shower after being outside, change clothes), medications (antihistamines - cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine; nasal corticosteroid sprays - fluticasone, most effective; decongestants - short-term only; eye drops for itchy eyes), saline nasal rinses, air purifiers with HEPA filters. Start medications before season begins for best results. Immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual tablets) for severe cases - provides long-term relief. See allergist for: severe symptoms, medication side effects, unclear triggers, consideration of immunotherapy. Prevention: identify specific triggers through testing, plan outdoor activities when pollen counts lower (after rain, evening).",

Important: many medications and supplements interfere with absorption (calcium, iron, antacids, soy - take 4 hours apart). Untreated hypothyroidism complications: heart disease, infertility, mental health issues, myxedema coma (rare but life-threatening). Most patients need lifelong treatment. With proper treatment, can live normal life. Monitor: symptoms, weight, energy levels, report changes to doctor. Regular follow-ups essential for dose optimization.",

Sources: sunlight (10-30 minutes midday sun several times weekly - varies by skin tone, latitude, season), fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), fortified foods (milk, orange juice, cereals), egg yolks, supplements (D3 more effective than D2). Risk factors for deficiency: limited sun exposure, dark skin, older age, obesity, malabsorption disorders, kidney/liver disease. Testing: 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood test - optimal level 30-50 ng/mL. Supplementation: if deficient, may need high-dose initially (50,000 IU weekly), then maintenance dose. Take with fat-containing meal for better absorption. Benefits of adequate levels: stronger bones, reduced fracture risk, better immune function, improved mood. Excessive amounts can cause toxicity (nausea, weakness, kidney problems).",
